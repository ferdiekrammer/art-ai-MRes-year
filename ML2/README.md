# Machine Learnin 1

This course constituted 2 group projects:

The first of which was to create 2 CNNs, the report for this is found [here](CNN_and_Transfer_Learning.pdf). Both CNNs take in images of faces and predict the age and gender of the person in the image. The first CNN is a full custom CNN and the second one is based on a pretrained CNN.
